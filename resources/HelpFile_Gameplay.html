<h1>Gameplay Help</h1>
<p>
Welcome to Projectile Battle. It plays a lot like the turn based game Battleship, only you have to do calculations based on where you want your projectile to land. 
This makes the game's mechanics and gameplay quasi-pseudo-realistic-ish. This help section focuses on just the gameplay, not on the physics or how to do calculations.
</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of Projectile Battle, like Battleship, is to destroy all of your opponent's ships.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p> 
First both players place their ships. Then they take turns firing projectiles into the other player's territory.
The ship that is currently firing is colored <font style="color:#00ff00;">green</font>. 
The player who's turn it is must pick a firing location, do some calculations, enter the results, and press the launch button. 
The projectile will be colored <font style="color:#ffff00;">yellow</font>. When the projectile lands in the water or hits a ship a portion of the obscured territory will be revealed. 
If it hits a ship, then any portions of a ship in the territory will also be revealed, then the player will get to go again. The player can keep firing projectiles as long as they keep hitting up to three times in row.
On the next player's turn, he/she will be able to see where the previous player's projectiles landed and if they hit anything, but (s)he won't be able to see where it was fired from.
</p>
<p>
<font class="boldSection">Sinking Ships: </font>Each "ship" is made up of 3 to 18 squares or "portions." 
To sink the other player's ship, you must damage all of the portions of that ship. A damaged portion is colored <font style="color:#ffff00;">yellow</font> and a sunken ship is colored <font style="color:#ffaa00;">orange</font>. 
Both players can see their own and their opponents damaged and sunken ships. Gameplay ends when all of the ships of one player have been sunk.
</p>
<p>
<font class="boldSection">Calculations: </font> To actually learn how to do the calculations go to the "physics" help section. The game consists of two different difficulty levels.
Easier calculations involve only bearing and range. Harder calculations involve bearing, launch velocity, and launch angle. For harder calculations either launch velocity or launch angle may at times get "stuck".
This is because the ship is "malfunctioning." Despite this, it is usually possible to hit any place on the map when something is stuck; You just have less freedom with your calculations.
</ul
</p>
<h2>Strategy/Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><font class="boldSection">Don't clump your ships together:</font> Space out your ships during ship placement. Clumping them together may trick your opponent for a while, 
but as soon as your opponent hits a part of the clump they will be able to easily destroy all of the ships stuck together.
<li><font class="boldSection">Be careful when doing calculations:</font> Firing outside the grid is a wasted shot, and firing inside your half of the grid is even worse. 
If you land a projectile on your half, that portion of the grid will be revealed to the other player. If you manage to hit one of your own ships, it will sustain damage and it counts as a miss so you won't get to go again.
<li><font class="boldSection">Plan your target carefully:</font> The radius of the explosions of the projectiles are just a little bit larger than 2 meters (one square) in diameter on the grid. This means that, at most, one explosion can damage/reveal four squares. 
To take advantage of this, you should almost always fire at the intersection of two lines on the grid. The exception being when doing so would damage one of your own ships.
<li><font class="boldSection">Be strategic:</font> If you've played Battleship before, this one should be obvious. If you hit a portion of a ship and get to go again, don't fire randomly, fire in the same general area until the ship's sunk.
</ul>
